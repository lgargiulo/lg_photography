# CLAUDE.md

## Git Operations

Before any git operation (commit, push, branch, etc.), ALWAYS read `docs/GIT_SETUP.md` first and follow its instructions.

Key rules:
- Use `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` before any push command
- Never mention AI, Claude, or any AI tool in commit messages
- No `Co-Authored-By` AI lines in commits
- Push to personal account `lgargiulo`, not work account
